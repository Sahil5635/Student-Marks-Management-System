This project on “Student Marks Management System” is useful for an easy user interface. The system utilizes powerful database management, data retrieval, and data manipulation. This project provides more ease for managing the data than manually maintaining the documents. The project is useful for saving valuable time and reducing the huge paperwork.
 It will help educational Institutions like schools and colleges will keep track of their student records like personal details, contact details, marks details, etc. The Internet is rapidly becoming a part of the everyday lives of a majority of people in the world. People perform various activities on the Internet and one of them is storing their data in databases where they are interested. In these databases, they can post the queries and they can retrieve the required data. 
There is a need for Student Information System software for the management of students’ data. There are many departments of administration for the maintenance of college information and student databases in any institution. 
All these departments provide various records regarding students. Most of these track records need to maintain information about the students. This information could be the general details like student name, batch, performance, roll no., etc, or specific information related to departments like a collection of data. All the modules in college administration are interdependent. They are maintained manually. 

So, they need to be automated and centralized as Information from one module will be needed by other modules. For example, when a student needs his course completion certificate it needs to check many details about the student like his name, ID, batch, marks, and many other details. So, it needs to contact all the modules that our office, department, and examination and the result of students.
